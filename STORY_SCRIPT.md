# ClaimGuard AI — Story Script
### "Stop Denials Before They Happen"

---

Every year, hospitals and health systems lose billions of dollars — not because of bad medicine, but because of bad paperwork.

A missing authorization here. An incorrect modifier there. Documentation that wasn't attached. A code that doesn't quite match. Small errors. Costly consequences.

The average provider writes off nearly **$5 million annually** to claim denials that were entirely preventable. And the painful truth is — most of those denials are discovered only after the claim has already been submitted, reviewed, and rejected by the payer. By then, the damage is done. The clock for appeal is ticking. And the revenue cycle team is buried under rework they never should have needed to do.

This is the world Revenue Cycle Management teams have lived in for decades.

**ClaimGuard AI** was built to change that.

Meet the team at MedCore Health Systems. Like every health system, they process hundreds of claims every day — surgical procedures, cardiology workups, cancer treatments, emergency visits, routine preventive care. Each one represents a patient served and a service rendered. Each one deserves to be paid.

Their Revenue Cycle team includes three types of people working toward one goal: clean claims, fast reimbursement, and zero preventable denials.

**Marcus**, the Claims Intake Specialist, is the first line of defense. Every claim that enters the system passes through him. His job is to make sure claims are complete, routed correctly, and moving through the pipeline without delay.

**Sarah**, the Denial Analyst, is the strategist. She watches the patterns. She knows which payers are most aggressive, which procedure codes draw the most scrutiny, and which teams need to move faster. Her job is to prevent revenue loss before it happens.

And **Priya**, the Medical Coder, is the precision expert. She speaks fluent CPT and ICD-10. She knows when a modifier is wrong, when two codes conflict, when a diagnosis doesn't support a procedure. She is the last technical checkpoint before a claim goes out the door.

All three of them now have something they never had before — a team of six AI agents working alongside them, around the clock, on every single claim.

The six agents of ClaimGuard AI each have a specific mission.

The **Demographics Agent** verifies that every patient identity detail — name, date of birth, member ID, address — matches what the payer has on file. A ZIP code discrepancy seems minor. To a payer's system, it can be grounds for rejection.

The **Eligibility Agent** digs deeper. Is this patient's coverage active on the date of service? Does this procedure require prior authorization? Has a referral been obtained? Is the provider even credentialed with this payer? These are the questions that, unanswered, become denial letters.

The **Clinical Documentation Agent** reads the claim like an auditor. Are the imaging reports attached? Is the operative note complete? Does the clinical record actually support the medical necessity for what was billed? Missing a single document can unravel an otherwise clean claim.

The **Medical Coding Agent** checks every code with the precision of a seasoned coder. Wrong modifier. Incorrect laterality. Two codes that can't be billed together. An age range that doesn't match the patient. Each one flagged, explained, and corrected before submission.

The **Charge Review Agent** compares every billed charge against the payer's fee schedule and the local usual, customary, and reasonable benchmarks. A charge that's 15% above UCR doesn't just get adjusted — it gets scrutinized, often denied.

And at the center of it all — the **Denial Prediction Agent**. This is the intelligence that ties every signal together. Drawing on years of historical claim data, payer behavior patterns, and the findings of all five preceding agents, it assigns every claim a denial risk score from zero to one hundred — and it tells your team exactly why.

Let's walk through a real example.

Claim CLM-2025-001. Patient Robert Martinez, a 67-year-old with severe osteoarthritis of the right knee. His orthopedic surgeon has recommended a total knee replacement — a major procedure billed at over $20,000 to BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois.

On the surface, this looks routine. The procedure is appropriate. The surgeon is credentialed. The patient is covered.

But ClaimGuard AI flags this claim immediately. Risk score: **92 out of 100**. Critical.

The Eligibility Agent found it first. CPT code 27447 — total knee arthroplasty — requires prior authorization from BlueCross BlueShield. There is no authorization on file. If this claim is submitted today, it will be denied automatically, without review, without appeal rights, without recourse. That's $20,000 in jeopardy.

The Clinical Documentation Agent found it next. The surgeon's notes reference an X-ray from January and an MRI from December that clearly show the severity of the patient's condition. But neither report is attached to the claim. Without them, the payer cannot confirm medical necessity. Denial risk climbs higher.

The Medical Coding Agent identified a modifier conflict. A small coding error — a redundant modifier on a secondary procedure code — contradicts the primary diagnosis. It's the kind of thing that slips through without AI review. Small error. Automatic edit flag. Another denial reason.

The Denial Prediction Agent has seen this pattern before. Forty-seven times, to be exact. In 89% of those cases, the claim was denied. The AI knows this because it has learned from every claim this organization has ever submitted — and from the behavioral patterns of this specific payer.

But here's what makes ClaimGuard AI genuinely different from any system that came before it.

It doesn't just identify the problem. It prescribes the solution.

Four corrective actions, ranked by priority and impact.

**First:** Obtain the prior authorization. Call BlueCross BlueShield. Reference member ID BCBS0012345678. Submit through the Availity portal. Include the conservative treatment history — six months of physical therapy, NSAIDs, and failed injections. Completing this one action alone drops the denial risk by 45 points.

**Second:** Attach the missing imaging reports. The X-ray from January. The MRI from December. They're in the system. They just aren't on the claim. Two clicks, and the documentation gap is closed.

**Third:** Fix the modifier on the secondary procedure code. A five-minute task for Priya, the Medical Coder. Another 8 points of risk eliminated.

**Fourth:** Ask the physician to add a brief note documenting why conservative treatment failed and why surgery was the appropriate next step. Thirty minutes of clinical documentation that protects against medical necessity challenges.

Every action has a clear owner. A clear timeline. A clear impact on the risk score. And the claim cannot be submitted — ClaimGuard AI locks the submit button — until the high-priority actions are resolved.

Not because the system doesn't trust the team. But because the data is unambiguous: this claim, submitted without these fixes, will be denied.

---

Three days later, the prior authorization is approved. The imaging reports are attached. Priya has corrected the modifier. The physician has added a clinical note.

The claim is submitted. Paid on first pass. Full reimbursement.

$20,000 in revenue that, in the old world, would have become a denial letter, a frustrated phone call, weeks of rework, and a likely write-off.

This is one claim. On one day. For one patient.

Multiply it across the dozens of high-risk claims ClaimGuard AI reviews every single day — and the impact becomes transformational. Fewer denials. Fewer appeals. Lower administrative cost. Faster cash flow. A Revenue Cycle team that leads with data instead of reacting to problems.

---

ClaimGuard AI doesn't replace the experts on your team. It makes every expert exponentially more effective.

Marcus processes more claims with fewer errors. Sarah prevents denials instead of chasing them. Priya catches coding issues in minutes instead of discovering them in denial letters weeks later.

Six AI agents. Three empowered roles. One mission.

**Predict and prevent claims denials — before they happen.**

This is Revenue Cycle Management, reimagined.

*ClaimGuard AI. Because every claim deserves to be paid.*
