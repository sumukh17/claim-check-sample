## PRE-ROLL TITLE CARD
*[Black screen. Ambient healthcare ambient sound fades in — soft monitor beeps, keyboard taps.]*
*[Text appears on screen: "The average hospital loses $5 million annually to avoidable claim denials."]*
*[Pause 2 seconds. Text fades.]*
*[New text: "What if you could stop them before they happen?"]*

---

## SCENE 1 — THE PROBLEM (0:00 – 0:45)
*[Screen: Black background, text animation]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "In healthcare revenue cycle management, claim denials are not just frustrating — they are expensive. Each denied claim costs a provider an average of $25 to rework, and nearly 65% of denied claims are never resubmitted at all. That is revenue walking out the door.

> The traditional approach? Submit the claim, wait weeks for a response, receive a denial letter, and then begin the slow, painful process of investigation and appeal.

> But what if your team could predict a denial — with 94% accuracy — before a single claim ever left your system?

> Introducing **ClaimGuard AI** — the intelligent denial prevention platform built for modern Revenue Cycle Management."

---

## SCENE 2 — LOGIN PAGE: MEET THE PLATFORM (0:45 – 1:30)
*[Screen: ClaimGuard AI login page fades in — dark navy background, three glowing role cards]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "ClaimGuard AI is designed around the people who do the work every day.

> Three distinct roles. Three purpose-built workspaces. All powered by six specialized AI agents working in real time.

> The **Claims Intake Specialist** manages the front door — validating patient data, routing claims, and monitoring the processing pipeline.

> The **Denial Analyst** is the strategist — reviewing AI risk predictions, assigning corrective workflows, and tracking the financial impact of every prevented denial.

> And the **Medical Coder** is the precision expert — catching coding errors, modifier conflicts, and bundling issues before they trigger an automatic rejection.

> Every role. Every workflow. Connected by one intelligent platform."

*[Cursor hovers over Denial Analyst card, highlighting it. Click animation.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Today, let's step into the world of the Denial Analyst."

---

## SCENE 3 — DENIAL ANALYST DASHBOARD (1:30 – 2:30)
*[Screen: Denial Analyst Dashboard animates in — KPI cards, charts, activity feed]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The moment you log in, the picture is clear.

> Today, there are **44 claims** in active review. **Eight of them** carry a high or critical denial risk — and together they represent over **$68,000** in charges that could be lost if nothing is done.

> But this month, ClaimGuard AI has already helped prevent **$127,000** in denials. That's money that would have been written off, now flowing back into the revenue cycle.

> The **Denial Trend chart** tells the full story — when the platform was deployed nine months ago, actual denials began a consistent downward trajectory, even as the volume of at-risk claims was detected and intercepted by the AI."

*[Camera zooms into the Denial Trend area chart — the gap between 'Predicted' and 'Actual' widens over time, 'Prevented' bar grows.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The green line — claims prevented by AI intervention — grows larger every single month. This is the compounding value of intelligent denial prevention.

> The **Top Denial Reasons chart** shows us where the risk is concentrated. Prior authorization failures account for nearly one in three denials. Medical necessity documentation issues come second. These are not random — they are predictable, and they are preventable."

*[Highlight the agent activity feed in the bottom right.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "And in real time, the six AI agents are working — every claim, every minute. New flags surface instantly, so your team knows exactly where to focus."

---

## SCENE 4 — CLAIMS LIST: RISK AT A GLANCE (2:30 – 3:00)
*[Screen: Click "All Claims" in sidebar — ClaimsListPage slides in]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The Claims Management view gives the entire team a unified, prioritized picture of every claim in the pipeline.

> Risk scores — from 0 to 100 — are calculated by the AI for every single claim. Critical and High risk claims surface immediately, sorted by urgency. Green for safe. Amber for caution. Orange for high risk. Red for critical — act now.

> The predicted denial reason is visible right here in the table — so a Denial Analyst can triage at a glance, without opening a single claim."

*[Filter to show only Critical claims — 2 claims appear highlighted in red.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "With a single filter, we can focus exclusively on the claims that need immediate attention. Let's open the highest-risk claim in the queue."

---

## SCENE 5 — CLAIM DETAIL: THE AI AGENTS AT WORK (3:00 – 4:15)
*[Screen: Click on CLM-2025-001 — Claim Detail page opens with Robert Martinez's claim]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Claim CLM-2025-001. Patient Robert Martinez. A total knee replacement procedure billed at $20,120 to BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois.

> At first glance, this looks like a routine surgical claim. But ClaimGuard AI has assigned this claim a **risk score of 92 out of 100** — Critical. The AI predicts an **89% probability of denial** based on 47 similar historical cases with this payer.

> Let's see exactly what the agents found."

*[Click through agent tabs one by one — Demographics, Eligibility, Clinical Doc, Medical Coding, Charge Review]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The **Demographics Agent** completed in milliseconds — patient identity verified, insurance active. One minor ZIP code discrepancy flagged for correction.

> The **Eligibility Agent** — here's where the first major issue appears. CPT code 27447, total knee arthroplasty, **requires prior authorization** from BlueCross BlueShield. And there is none on file. This claim, submitted today, will be denied automatically.

> The **Clinical Documentation Agent** found that the radiology reports — an X-ray and an MRI referenced in the clinical notes — are missing from the claim attachments. Without them, medical necessity cannot be established by the payer.

> The **Medical Coding Agent** flagged a modifier conflict on CPT 20680 — the RT modifier is redundant and contradicts the primary diagnosis code. A small error, but enough to trigger a rejection.

> And the **Charge Review Agent** notes that the primary procedure charge is running 14% above the local UCR benchmark for this payer — a potential flag for additional scrutiny."

*[Pause for effect.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Five agents. Five analyses. All completed in under three minutes — before a human being has touched this claim."

## SCENE 6 — DENIAL PREDICTION AGENT: THE CENTERPIECE (4:15 – 5:15)
*[Screen: Click "Denial Prediction" tab — or click "View Prediction" button. The AI panel comes into focus.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Now, the Denial Prediction Agent brings it all together.

> The risk gauge reads **92** — deep into the critical zone. The AI model is operating at **94% confidence**. It has seen this pattern before — 47 times, to be precise — and in **89% of those cases**, the claim was denied."

*[Camera focuses on the circular gauge, then pans down to the predicted denial reason box.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The primary predicted denial reason is unambiguous: **Prior Authorization Not Obtained**. The secondary risks — medical necessity documentation and modifier conflict — compound the overall exposure.

> But here is what makes ClaimGuard AI different from any reporting tool you've ever used."

*[Scroll down to the Risk Factors section — bars animate in.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The AI doesn't just tell you there is a problem. It tells you **exactly why** — weighted by impact.

> The missing prior authorization contributes **45 percentage points** to this claim's risk score. High-cost procedure scrutiny adds 18 more. Incomplete documentation, 10. Each factor is explained in plain language, categorized, and ranked.

> Your team doesn't need to guess. The AI has already done the diagnosis."

---

## SCENE 7 — CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: THE PRESCRIPTION (5:15 – 6:00)
*[Screen: Focus shifts to the Corrective Actions sidebar on the right]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "And then ClaimGuard AI prescribes the cure.

> Four corrective actions, ranked by priority.

> **High Priority:** Obtain the prior authorization from BlueCross BlueShield before submitting. The platform tells you exactly which portal to use, which member ID to reference, and what clinical documentation to include. Complete this one action, and the denial risk drops by **45 points**.

> **High Priority:** Attach the missing radiology reports — the X-ray from January and the MRI from December. The agent has identified exactly which documents are missing and what the payer needs to see.

> **Medium Priority:** Remove the conflicting modifier on CPT 20680. A five-minute fix for the Medical Coder that eliminates another 8 points of risk.

> **Low Priority:** Strengthen the conservative treatment documentation — a 30-minute task for the physician that further supports medical necessity."

*[Click the status dropdown on the first action — change from "Pending" to "In Progress"]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Every action can be tracked in real time. When the prior auth comes back approved, the team marks it complete — the risk score updates, and the claim moves closer to clean submission.

> If all four actions are completed, this claim's projected denial risk drops from **92 to below 30** — from Critical all the way to Low."

*[The sidebar shows the projected score drop animation.]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The submit button at the bottom remains locked until high-priority actions are resolved. ClaimGuard AI won't let a high-risk claim slip through — even on a busy day."

---

## SCENE 8 — BROADER IMPACT (6:00 – 6:30)
*[Screen: Return to Denial Analyst Dashboard — charts visible]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Multiply this across dozens of claims a day, hundreds a month — and the numbers become transformational.

> Fewer denials means fewer appeals. Fewer appeals means lower administrative cost. Faster clean claims mean faster reimbursement. And faster reimbursement means healthier cash flow for the entire organization.

> ClaimGuard AI doesn't replace your Revenue Cycle team — it makes every person on that team dramatically more effective. Your coders catch errors before submission. Your eligibility specialists fix authorization gaps proactively. Your denial analysts lead with data, not gut feeling.

> This is Revenue Cycle Management, reimagined."

---

## SCENE 9 — CLOSING (6:30 – 7:00)
*[Screen: Fade back to the ClaimGuard AI login page — glowing in the dark]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "ClaimGuard AI. Six intelligent agents. Three empowered roles. One mission — **predict and prevent claims denials before they happen**.

> Stop reacting to denials. Start preventing them."

*[Logo and tagline animate in: "ClaimGuard AI — Denial Prevention, Powered by AI"]*

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Request your personalized demo today."
